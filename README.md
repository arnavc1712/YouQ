YouQ answers questions about the video you are watching and provides additional context in order to help you understand it better
Have you ever watched a video (may it be for learning, news or entertainment) and found yourself doing either of the following things:
- rewinding to revisit a part of the video because you wanted more clarification
- jumping onto google to search something you heard on the video
- have more context into the video (what does this mean, who is this guy)

YouQ is a chat assistant which is with you whenever you are watching any video and provides rich context into the video you are watching. Just put in your OpenAI Key (we only save it on your browser) and you are good to go :)
